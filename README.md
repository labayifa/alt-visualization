## Exploration
#### Prosper Loan DataSet

> Prosper Loan Data set contain 113 937 loan with 81 variables to describe each observation about the borrower, the loan. Because of the large number of variable that we have, my first thougth was to sort the relation between all varaible to see if we are in case of merged dataset or informatio from different source. By following this exploration I found that we some variables have more thant __25%__ of their values null.

#### Exploratory And Conclusion:
> Second step we remove theses unuseful variables, then explore again variable type by type and choosed now 12 variables from all the dataset.

> Now we have proceed with univariate, bivariate and multivariate exploration and finally get:
    - which group of people demanding the most and highest loans, and also what is their salary range.
    - why people without income veriable have gotten loan
    - Is the loan attribute following correct choice ?
